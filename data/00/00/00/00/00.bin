  |   Life went on as usual in the Inkland... until the Tower fell          |
  |   straight from the sky! Many heroes tried to solve its mystery, but    |
  |   none of them succeeded. It's your turn to prove your worth.           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Choose your class - warrior, magician or rogue - each with their      |
  |   own strength and abilities. Loot and buy items, fight with various    |
  |   weapons, create and cast powerful spells. All the ingredients of a    |
  |   good role-playing game are there, but with a unique real-time         |
  |   combat based on grid movement - like on a piece of paper! The         |
  |   hand-drawn graphics especially fit the dark and old-school heroic     |
  |   fantasy settings.                                                     |
